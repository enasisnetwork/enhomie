## Installing the package
Installing stable from the PyPi repository
```
pip install enhomie
```
Installing latest from GitHub repository
```
pip install git+https://github.com/enasisnetwork/enhomie
```

## Quick start for local development
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/enasisnetwork/enhomie.git
```
Set up the Python virtual environments expected by the Makefile.
```
make -s venv-create
```

### Execute the linters and tests
The comprehensive approach is to use the `check` recipe. This will stop on
any failure that is encountered.
```
make -s check
```
However you can run the linters in a non-blocking mode.
```
make -s linters-pass
```
And finally run the various tests to validate the code and produce coverage
information found in the `htmlcov` folder in the root of the project.
```
make -s pytest
```
